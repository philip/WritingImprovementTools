Originally this was a port from the following source:

 - http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/

Where the shell scripts (e.g., weasel.sh) were rewritten in PHP. Then, it was expanded.

Also, David Tajchreber was kind enough to help brain storm and improve the code.
